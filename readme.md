## Elements Used
| Term  | Description | Implement |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| **Box-Sizing** | This property tells the browser what parts of the box model should be included in the elements total width and height| I used box-sizing to the entire document to normalize the outside dimensions of every container|
| **Float** |takes element outside the flow of the containing element, specifies which direction it should be moved.| I used float to seperate the table section and the image gallery|
|**display: block**| is the standard block-level element. A block-level element starts on a new line and stretches out to the left and right as far as it can.| used to display the paragraph elements|
| **display: inline**| An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.| used for the picture gallery and the ul element in the header to display them next to each other|
| **centered contact** | center content within in a container | used the margin: 0 auto to center the image gallery and vertical-align: middle to center the images within their own container|
|**pseudo-element**| pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element. For example, it can be used to: Style the first letter, or line, of an element. Insert content before, or after, the content of an element.|used the :before psuedo element to add content before each ul |
|**pseudo-class**|A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. | sed the :hover psuedo element to had a hover effect to the ul |
| **clear-fix** | A clearfix is a way for an element to automatically clear its child elements, so that you don't need to add additional markup. | used in almost all parent elements to clear the floats |
|**positional selector** | way to select elements based on their position in the html | used both :first-child and :last-child to select p elements |
|**selector combinator** | A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator. | Used with many selectors like ".header li a" to select just the anchor tag within the li within the class selector header|
